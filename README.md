## Project Overview

This project implements and compares three machine learning models for breast cancer classification:
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest

The analysis includes data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and comprehensive performance evaluation using multiple metrics.

## Dataset

The project uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set from scikit-learn, which includes:
- 30 features computed from digitized images of breast mass
- Binary classification: malignant vs. benign
- 569 instances
